  NowSecure provides purpose-built, fully automated mobile application security testing (static and dynamic) for your development pipeline. By testing your mobile application binary post-build from Azure, NowSecure ensures comprehensive coverage of newly developed code, third party components, and system dependencies.

  NowSecure quickly identifies and details real issues, provides remediation recommendations, and integrates with ticketing systems such as Azure DevOps and Jira.

  This integration requires a NowSecure platform license. See https://www.nowsecure.com for more information.
